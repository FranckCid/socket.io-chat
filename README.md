"Get Started" Project from socket.io website, with some little adaptations.
This projects run a backend server that listens to it's clients requests and operates as a real time chat application.

## How to use

Install all dependencies:
**npm:**
`npm i`
**yarn:**
`yarn install`

Run the `index.js` file using `node` or `nodemon`
`node index.js`

Now the server is listening on port 3000.
Open your browser on `localhost:3000`.

**And have fun.**
